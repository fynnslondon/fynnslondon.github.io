										<a class="questions" name="about"><b class="orange">ABOUT FYNNS' AND IZABELLA MODELS</b></a><br>
										Established in 1984, IZABELLA Models is a leader in the development and placement of new
										models into the world's leading international modeling agencies.
										Models discovered by IZABELLA Models work around the world and have appeared in major magazines including 
										<b>Vogue, Glamour, Harpers Bazaar, Elle, Seventeen, Amica, Cosmopolitan, Marie Claire, Gear, Teen Vogue, Elle Girl, Self, Fitness, Modern Bride...</b> and have worked for the 
										fashion industry's leading clients and designers including <b>Giorgio Armani, Chanel, Gucci, Givenchy, Versace, Versus, Dolce & Gabbana, Prada, 
										Christian Lacroix, Bagley Mischka, Abercrombie and Fitch, Bill Blass, Calvin Klein, Valentino, Dior, Louis Vuitton, Yves. St. Laurent, Max Mara, Cartier, Tiffany and Co., 
										Clairol, Pantene, Ponds, Revlon, Matrix, Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Holt Renfrew</b> and many, many more!<br><br>
										
										In the Summer of 2000, IZABELLA Models expanded the agency from female editorial models only to include male models, 
										child models, petite and plus-size models.  As IZABELLA Models is known within the industry for representing female 
										editorial models only, it was determined that the new division should have its own unique identity.  
										Hence the new division - Fynns' Models.<br>
										<br>
										<a class="questions" name="bbb"><b class="orange">ARE YOU A MEMBER OF THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU?</b></a><br>
										Yes.  Fynns' Models is a proud member of the BBB and has received the BBB Online Reliability Seal for excellence.<br><br>
										<!--<div align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" alt="" width="33" height="15" border="0"></a></div>-->
										<a class="questions" name="located"><b class="orange">CONTACT INFORMATION</b></a><br>
										Please <a href="contact.html">click here</a> for detailed contact information.<br><br>
										<!--<div align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" alt="" width="33" height="15" border="0"></a></div>-->
										<a class="questions" name="management"><b class="orange">WHAT IS THE MANAGEMENT DIVISION OF FYNNS' MODELS?</b></a><br>
										The Management Division of Fynns' Models represents experienced, professional models.  Models in our Management Division have worked 
										internationally in major markets such as New York, Los Angeles, Paris, Milan, Germany, Tokyo, Singapore, Taipei and Korea and have high-quality
										tearsheets in their books.<br><br>
										<div align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" alt="" width="33" height="15" border="0"></a></div>	
										<a class="questions" name="freelance"><b class="orange">WHAT IS THE FREELANCE DIVISION OF FYNNS' MODELS?</b></a><br>
										The Freelance Division of Fynns' Models provides an entry level for new models
										who would like the opportunity to be seen by our clients and be considered for bookings.
										The requirements for the Freelance Division are much more relaxed than that of our management divisions.
										This is great for new models who may not have the resources to have professional photos taken, who are
										working on their portfolios or who would just like to see what the response to them will be before investing  
										hundreds or thousands of dollars on photos, composite cards, modeling courses, model searches or conventions.<br><br>
										We understand that starting out and getting the attention of a reputable agency can be a difficult undertaking.  
										We also understand that by giving a new model an opportunity we could have a future superstar on our hands. 
										The Freelance Division is the best of both worlds, new models get incredible exposure to top clients and 
										international agencies who visit our website every day and we have the opportunity to be involved
										in a budding career right from the start. We are pleased to provide this unique opportunity to new models.<br><br> 
										<!--<div align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" alt="" width="33" height="15" border="0"></a></div>-->		
										<!--<a class="questions" name="accept"><b class="orange">I HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED AS A FREELANCE MODEL NOW WHAT DO I DO?</b></a><br>
										Congratulations on being accepted by our agency!   If you included your website fee with your photo submission then there is nothing more for you to do.  Your photos will be posted online within 5 business days.<br><br>
										If you did not include your website fee your account will be on hold for 30 days to give you enough time to submit your payment.  You may submit your payment by 
										credit card using our Secure Registration Form or you can mail a check or money order.  If your payment is not received within 30 days your account will be deleted and you will need 
										to resubmit your photos for approval.<br>
										<br>-->
										<!--<div align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" alt="" width="33" height="15" border="0"></a></div>-->
										<a class="questions" name="move"><b class="orange">HOW DO I MOVE FROM THE FREELANCE TO MANAGEMENT DIVISION?</b></a><br>
										All new models must begin in our Freelance Division (see above).  To be represented by our Management Division models must have
										professional experience and at least 5 high quality international tearsheets (magazine or commercial work) in their books.<br><br>
										<!--<div align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" alt="" width="33" height="15" border="0"></a></div>-->
										<a class="questions" name="contract"><b class="orange">DO FREELANCE MODELS HAVE TO SIGN A CONTRACT?</b></a><br>
										No, freelance models are not required to sign a contract with the agency.  As a freelance model you are 
										free to work with other agencies and book jobs outside of the agency. <br><br>
										<a class="questions" name="child"><b class="orange">DO YOU REPRESENT CHILD MODELS, PETITE MODELS AND PLUS SIZE MODELS?</b></a><br>
										Yes, we represent child models from toddlers to pre-teen as well as petite models and plus size models.<br><br>
										<a class="questions" name="parts"><b class="orange">DO YOU REPRESENT PARTS MODELS?</b></a><br>
										No, we do not represent parts models.  (Parts models model hands, feet, legs and other body parts.)<br><br>
										<!--<div align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" alt="" width="33" height="15" border="0"></a></div>-->
										<a class="questions" name="fee"><b class="orange">IS THERE A FEE TO BE REPRESENTED BY YOUR AGENCY?</b></a><br>
										No.  We do not charge fees for representation. We earn the standard 20% agency commission on work models
										perform through our agency.  <br>
										<br>
										<!--<div align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" alt="" width="33" height="15" border="0"></a></div>-->
										<a class="questions" name="why"><b class="orange">IS THERE A FEE TO BE ON THE FYNNS' WEBSITE?</b></a><br>	
										No.  In the past, models were required to cover their own expenses such as website fees.  But, recently Fynns' changed this policy and no longer charges models to post their photos on our website.
										<br><br>
										<!--<div align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" alt="" width="33" height="15" border="0"></a></div>-->
										<!--<a class="questions" name="why"><b class="orange">WHY IS THERE A FEE TO BE ON THE MINX WEBSITE?</b></a><br>
										Our website is managed by an independent web design company that is not part of our agency. Just as a printing company would charge 
										you to print composite cards or a photographer to shoot your photos, the web design company also 
										charges for their services.  Also, we do not sell advertising on our site which helps us maintain a high level of quality and
										prevents conflicts between our clients. <br>
										<br>-->
										<!--<div align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" alt="" width="33" height="15" border="0"></a></div>-->
										<!--<a class="questions" name="doall"><b class="orange">DO ALL OF YOUR MODELS HAVE TO PAY TO BE ON YOUR WEBSITE?</b></a><br>
										Yes.  All models are required to cover their own promotional expenses such as photoshoots, 
										composite cards, laser copies and website costs. It is EXTREMELY rare for our agency to ADVANCE (that is
										"advance", not "pay for") initial expenses and it would apply only to models with numerous
										tearsheets and international experience. All advances are immediately deducted from the model's first booking. 
										We do not finance expenses for new models.<br>
										<br> -->
										<!--<div align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" alt="" width="33" height="15" border="0"></a></div>--> 
										<!--<a class="questions" name="extra"><b class="orange">IS THERE AN EXTRA CHARGE TO UPDATE MY PHOTOS?</b></a><br>
										You may post a total of 8 photos on your online compcard.  This is an adequate amount of photos and it is rarely necessary for a model to showcase more than
										8 photos.  After you have posted a total of 8 photos (regardless of when they are posted) there will be a charge of $20.00 per photo to change or update photos. 
										<br><br> -->
										<!--<a class="questions" name="doi"><b class="orange">DO I HAVE TO INCLUDE MY WEBSITE FEE WHEN I SUBMIT MY PHOTOS?</b></a><br>
										It is not necessary to include your website fee before you photos are approved.  However, submissions that include the website fee will be reviewed within 5 business
										days.  Submissions that do not include the website fee will take 8 - 10 weeks to be reviewed.  Your credit card or check will not be processed unless your photos are approved, so most people
										include the website fee when submitting their photos in order to speed up the review process.<br><br>-->
										<!--<div align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" alt="" width="33" height="15" border="0"></a></div>-->
										<!--<a class="questions" name="time"><b class="orange">HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO MAKE MY PAYMENT FOR THE WEBSITE?</b></a><br>
										Your photos will be kept on file for 30 days after your acceptance has been sent to you.  Payments for the website
										fee must be made within 30 days after the agency has accepted you.  After 30 days your file will be deleted you must resubmit your photos for approval.<br>
										<br>-->
										<div align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" alt="" width="33" height="15" border="0"></a></div>
										<!--<a class="questions" name="visa"><b class="orange">MY PHOTOS HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED BUT I DO NOT HAVE A CREDIT CARD FOR THE WEBSITE FEE</b></a><br>
										Payments for the website fee can be made by credit card, international money order or check.<br><br>-->
										<!--<div align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" alt="" width="33" height="15" border="0"></a></div>-->
										<!--<a class="questions" name="likes"><b class="orange">IF AN AGENCY REALLY LIKES ME THEY WOULD PAY FOR EVERYTHING</b></a><br>
										Expenses are an area that seems to create the most confusion and misunderstandings between new models and agencies.
										Please <a href="modeling_expenses.html">click here</a> for detailed information on this and other modeling expenses such as photographers, make-up artists, comp cards, etc.<br><br>-->
										<!--<div align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" alt="" width="33" height="15" border="0"></a></div>-->
										<a class="questions" name="dos"><b class="orange">HOW DO I SUBMIT MY PHOTOS TO YOUR AGENCY?</b></a><br>
										Fynns' Models recently changed its photo submission process.  Please <a href="models_join.html">click here</a> for information on submitting your photos.<br><br>
										<!--<div align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" alt="" width="33" height="15" border="0"></a></div>-->
										<!--<a class="questions" name="ownsite"><b class="orange">I HAVE MY OWN WEBSITE, CAN'T YOU JUST TELL CLIENTS TO SEE ME THERE?</b></a><br>
										No.  If you are a model with our agency you still have to have your photos on our site. It would be extremely unprofessional of our agency and time-consuming for our clients to be directed to dozens of individual websites to find the right model for the job. In addition, our agency must maintain control
										over the quality of photos and the manner in which our models our represented. By allowing models to use individual websites we would be unable to maintain quality control.  Clients want to book models quickly from an established and professional agency. 
										Our website is accessed 24 hours a day by advertising agencies, magazine editors, photographers, stylists, clothing manufacturers, casting directors and international model agents and scouts. <br><br>-->
										<!--<div align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" alt="" width="33" height="15" border="0"></a></div>-->
										<!--<a class="questions" name="one"><b class="orange">I SENT SEVERAL PHOTOS BUT YOU ONLY PICKED ONE OR TWO, WHY?</b></a><br>
										New models are often surprised when an agency edits down their photos.  Most models believe that having a lot of photos 
										to show clients is a good thing, when often it is not.  You want to show your best and strongest photos only.  If that means only one out of ten then
										that's ok.  A client may think you look perfect for a job in one photo and then looks at other photos where you don't look your best and you can lose the job.
										When we choose a photo we look at many factors such as lighting, body position, clothing and the attitude or expression the model portrays in their photos.  If the photos 
										are basically the same style or don't really create a different mood or expression then they will usually be edited down to show only the 
										very best one.  Also, as a general rule we do not use more than one photo (two at the most) of the same style of photo or where the model is wearing the same outfit.  You also do not need more than one black and white headshot
										at a time. <br><br> 
										<div align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" alt="" width="33" height="15" border="0"></a></div>
										<a class="questions" name="photos"><b class="orange">HOW MANY PHOTOS CAN I POST ON THE MINX WEBSITE?</b></a><br>
										A total of 8 photos can be posted on your online compcard at one time. <br><br>-->
										<!--<div align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" alt="" width="33" height="15" border="0"></a></div>-->
										<!--<a class="questions" name="scanner"><b>I DON'T HAVE A SCANNER AND CANNOT UPLOAD MY PHOTOS.  WILL YOU SCAN THEM FOR ME?</a></b><br>
										Yes.  We will scan your first 3 photos for no charge.  For each photo scanned after the first 3 there is a $20.00 fee for each photo.<br><br>-->
										<!--<div align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" alt="" width="33" height="15" border="0"></a></div>-->
										<a class="questions" name="booking"><b class="orange">HAVE ANY MODELS IN YOUR FREELANCE DIVISION RECEIVED A BOOKING?</b></a><br>
										Yes! Many of our models have received bookings. One of our recent bookings was for freelance commercial model Calvin M.   &nbsp;&nbsp;Calvin, who is currently located in Mexico, was booked through our website for a T.V. commercial and print campaign for a major international resort and hotel chain which will air this summer in the U.S.
										Robina D. also began in our agency as a freelance model.  Within one month of having her photos posted online, Robina was signed by top Milan agency, Fashion Management.  Since then Robina has travelled to Milan and Germany and was recently signed to Next Models in Brazil. She has worked
										for many of the world's leading designers including Fendi, Chloe and Missoni.  Also, freelance models Sarah M., Ananda, Celine C. and Shawn K., Christine T., were all signed to major international agencies due to the exposure they received from being on our website and have since worked for major clients such as Chanel, Escada, Bill Blass, Versace, Fitness Magazine and Modern Bride.

										<a class="questions" name="clients"><b class="orange">HOW WILL I KNOW WHEN A CLIENT IS INTERESTED IN ME OR WANTS TO BOOK ME FOR A JOB?</b></a><br>
										The agency will contact you by email first and then by telephone to provide you with the details of your booking.<br>
										Please note, that the agency will contact you only when we have a definite booking for you.  The agency is simply too busy to contact models if a client
										has only expressed an interest in the model, has put them "on hold" or "on option" or if the agency is in the negotiation stage of the booking.<br>
										<br>
										<div align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" alt="" width="33" height="15" border="0"></a></div>
										<a class="questions" name="guarantee"><b class="orange">CAN YOU GUARANTEE THAT I WILL GET A JOB?</b></a><br>
										No.  No agency can guarantee work.  Ultimately, the client makes the final decision on whether or not a model is booked, not the agency.<br><br>
										<!--<div align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" alt="" width="33" height="15" border="0"></a></div>-->
										<a class="questions" name="city"><b class="orange">WHAT IF I DON'T LIVE IN THE SAME CITY AS YOUR AGENCY?</b></a><br>
										That's ok. Our models live all over the world. That is the nature of our business. Our models travel constantly and we are used to working under these conditions. <br><br>
										<!--<div align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" alt="" width="33" height="15" border="0"></a></div>-->
										<a class="questions" name="direct"><b class="orange">WHAT IS A DIRECT BOOKING?</b></a><br>
										If you are not located in the same city where the job will take place or if the client books you based on your photos only, the booking is considered a "direct booking".
										This also means that the client will be responsible for your travel and accommodation expenses so you can perform the job. <br><br>
										<a class="questions" name="notice"><b class="orange">IMPORTANT NOTICE TO MODELS</b></a><br>
